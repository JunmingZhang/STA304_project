* datagen.R: an R script to process the raw data, including computing the metrics we need, and combine the raw datasets and split the train and test dataset. It also can plot the data in the train set and test set.
* model.R: an R script to build the models and make diagnosis on models, the Rmarkdown uses the code in this file to generate the result and simulation we include in the report.
